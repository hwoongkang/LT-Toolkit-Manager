### Activation

You can use your leedotype toolkit license at the same time in up to 2 devices.

When you login in a device for the first time, you will get prompted to activate your device.

LT-Toolkit-Manager internally uses [MAC Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) to identify your device.

Since it doesn't mean much for human eyes, set the nickname so that in case you want to deactivate an older device you can identify it.
